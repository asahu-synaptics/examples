![Challenge](/samples/community.png)



## 🏆 Winner:
**Team:** Ignacy Kajdan, GRINN  

**Project:** [Bionic Robot Hand Demo](https://github.com.mcas.ms/grinn-global/bionic-robot-hand-demo)

**About the Winning Project:**
This outstanding project based on Task 1, implements real-time hand gesture recognition and robotic control using the Synaptics Astra SL1680 NPU with a YOLO-Pose model optimized by SyNAP. Their innovative approach features landmark detection, joint-angle calculations for precise servo control, and an engaging interactive frontend with a WebSocket JSON API. The application smoothly transitions between mirror mode and an engaging Rock-Paper-Scissors game!
